v0.3.5
-----------

Minor bugfix

* Skip uuid test if uuid is not available (e.g. on Solaris machines, thanks CRAN maintainers). 

v0.3.4
-----------

Minor bugfix

* Skip online tests if authentication fails 


v0.3.3
-----------

Minor bugfix

* tests use status codes instead of text parsing to determine API response errors. Makes tests more robust and compatible with latest `httr`, see [#84](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/84) 

v0.3.2
------

Minor bugfix

* include `httpuv` in imports (see [#82](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/82) and  [httr/110](https://github.com/hadley/httr/issues/110))

v0.3.1
------

Minor bugfix

* API now returns author ids as integers instead of character strings, breaking test. Test now fixed. 


v0.3
----

Major improvements to authentication.  First-time authentication no longer includes the tedious process
of getting and storing keys and tokens. This is all handled automatically thanks to improvements in
httr 0.3.  The use of explicitly passing tokens is still supported and used fo the internal/automated
testing of the package.  

* More explicit error handling ([#75](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/75))
* Handle the `mine` argument for `fs_details` automatically ([#76](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/76))
* Fixes fs_search ([#64](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/64)) and thus fs_ids, [#66](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/66).
* Fixes fs_browse (though API still limits to 10 results, [#77](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/77)).
* Fixes fs_create_authors ([#78](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/78)).

v0.2-9
-----
* Greatly streamlined authentication to avoid having to provide tokens. ([#72](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/72))
* Updated unit tests, and now run as part of check [#67](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/pull/67)
* Consistent with latest changes to httr ([#70](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/70))
* Includes travis continuous testing integration ([#69](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/issues/69))
* Displays a yaml-based summary from `fs_details`


v0.2-8
-----
* Minor bugfix: avoids the `text_content` warning ([#59](https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare/pull/59))
* Improved documentation and added ggplot2 to Imports list



v0.2-7
-----
* Bugfix following changes to API in `fs_update`
