\description{
Upload file to an article
}
\details{
Articles may be draft, private or public but all uploads are saved as draft changes - the canonical public version of the deposit is not updated. To update the public version of the repository, use \code{\link{fs_make_public}}. Only articles of type "fileset" can have multiple files uploaded.

If only a single id number is given but a character string of files is given,
then be sure that the id corresponds to an object of type "fileset".  If article_id list
has more than one id, then there must be a corresponding file path for each id.
